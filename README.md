Project Setup and Instructions
1. How to Run the Machine
Follow these steps to set up and run the development environment:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the development server:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
2. How to Run the Database Design
Ensure the database is set up and migrations are applied:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
If sample data is required, you can use the admin interface to add records:
Create a superuser:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Access the admin panel: Open a browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/.
Alternatively, seed data can be loaded using custom scripts or fixtures:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py loaddata <fixture_file.json>
3. How to Run the Code
Start the application after completing setup:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Test endpoints using:
Postman/Thunder Client: Import the API collection or manually test the endpoints.
Swagger UI: If enabled, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/.
To test the project functionality:
Add clients, users, and projects through the provided endpoints or the admin interface.
Validate responses via the API.
